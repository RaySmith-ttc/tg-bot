/**
 * By default, all bots are able to broadcast up to
 * [30 messages](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this) per second to their
 * users. Developers can increase this limit by enabling Paid Broadcasts in [@Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) -
 * allowing their bot to broadcast **up to 1000 messages** per second.
 *
 * Each message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 messages per second incurs a cost of 0.1 Stars per message, paid
 * with Telegram Stars from the bot's balance. In order to use this feature, a bot must have at least 10,000 Stars on
 * its balance.
 *
 * > Bots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully.
